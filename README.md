Abstract: The number of licensed drivers and motorvehicles has been increasing over the last several decades.
This increase in the number of drivers and vehicles implies that there is more traffic on the roads which creates a greater
need for more parking. However, the number of parking spaces is not increasing at the rate that traffic is increasing.
This is creating a somewhat overlooked issue in the parking sector. People are now on average spending more time and
resources driving around searching for a parking space. The time spent searching for parking is causing people to waste
time on an action that is unproductive, meaningless, and often frustrating. The wasted time and resources should instead be
put towards benefiting the people and their societies. In this paper we propose a solution for parking problems using the
Internet of Things (IoT) and data analytics, we call this solution TruParking. TruParking offers a means by which
users can reduce the time and resources they waste searching parking lots (or parking garages) for available parking
spaces.
